# react-menu-and-tabs #
Simple implementation of three level hierarchy

## Installation ##
You just need to clone this repository, and execute following commands

```
#!bash
npm install
npm start
```

After this you can open application in browser through http://localhost:18080

## Configuration ##
In order to configure application you need to edit ./config/default.json file, there are only two sections "server" and "menu", first one for server configuration, second one for hierarchy configuration

## Known issues ##
There is one noticeable issue, which I have no time to overcome, it is tabs glitching on going back
